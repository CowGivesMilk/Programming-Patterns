It is notes on programming patterns. It is based on the book [Game Programming patterns](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/introduction.html) by Bob Nystrom. The book is focused from the point of view of game development but notes are abstracted to general programming.

Use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) note taking software to read it since the notes are written for Obsidian. 

It is a work in progress.
